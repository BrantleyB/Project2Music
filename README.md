# Music Store

[Site](https://cryptic-sea-10393.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup
I used basic routes to create the site. All 7 restful routes are in there along with all the corresponding ejs files. I even added a kind of intro ejs file to enter you into the site.
## Challenges
The biggest challenges I faced were definitely with the css. I'm somewhat happy with how it turned out but there are a lot of minor details that I just couldn't get quite right.
## Added Features
I would have loved to add a review function to the site so users could review the albums and rate them on a scale of 1-5. I would have also loved to implement a login feature that saved favorite albums or attributed the comments with that login username.
